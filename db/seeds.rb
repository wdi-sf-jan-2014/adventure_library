  north and east, towards Agmar.  There Frodo finds he has strange new abilities.  He realizes objects in the world have begun bending to his will 
  and orcs do not hurt him.  Spending years roaming the country side, Frodo grows into his powers.  He can cross great rivers by moving them from 
  his way.  Mountains are no larger than ant hills and his small sword-arm is able to fell a tree in a single swing.  He has even attacked towns unprovoked.  
  Frodo meets a man named Strider who claims to be hunting a rogue hobbit for killing innocent people.  Frodo fights and slays Strider on the top of 
  Weathertop.  Soon after, Frodo finds Gandalf at Orthanc and Gandalf reveals that Frodo is being used by the One Ring in its attempt to serve Sauron and that he 
  slayed the last hope for men to rise against this evil.  Frodo makes it clear that he is the new evil and decides that it is time to strike.  He 
  destroys Gandalf and raises Orthanc down to the ground.  Saruman was still inside.  The elves get wind of what happened in Orthanc and decide to 
  put an end to Frodo.  Their attempts are fruitless and Frodo single-handedly defeats most of the combined forces of Elrond, Galadriel, and Thranduil.  
  The men of Gondor and Rohan attempt to help the elves, but are lost without a strong leader and perish.  Frodo remembers what Gandalf taught him 
  of the origin of the One Ring and decides to turn his might on Barad-dur.  With his small elvish sword, Frodo destroys the tower and causes Mount Doom 
  to erupt, laying waste to all of Mordor.  Finally, with the free peoples of Middle-Earth destroyed, Frodo travels to the Southfarthing and sits atop 
  the highest point of Erebor and enjoys the best long-bottom leaf pipe-weed in all of his new kingdom.")

  One night the blue dots started moving and then the horn was heard.  Three distinct blasts, telling all who could hear that the Others were coming.  Soon the ground at the foot of

  Over the hill, behind the battle field, an army of giants and Wildlings appeared.  Mance Rayder lead his rag-tag army of northern in habitants previously assembled to 
  take over Westeros to the aide of his former brothers.  Mance is a turncloak and now rides to save those who he abandoned.  Mance Rayder single handedly saves Westeros with his
